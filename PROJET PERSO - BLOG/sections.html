        <h2 class="rubrikName">HOW DID I GET THE IDEA to become a Web Developer</h2>
        <p>Everything started during the first lockdown (COVID-19) that took place in the begining of March 2020 TO London. I was enjoying my days off getting paid by the government with the furlough scheme. I had my girlfriend and my friends with me, so I was really enjoying my time. Playing League of Legends, World of Warcraft, watching movies...
        <p>But after a month and a half of fun, I started to think about my situation. I was working in the hospitality industry before the COVID-19 strikes our dear Earth. I moved in London in the fourth part of the year 2019, and working as a waiter was an easy way of earning enough money in order to pay my bills, enjoy the London life, and the most important thing, STAY in London.</p>
        <p>But yeah honestly, nothing really exciting about this job. So I decided to think about what do I really want to do with my life ? It became an obsession. I even started to panick sometimes because, common! I was thinking "What do I want to spend my most precious ressource, time, for the rest of my life for ?".</p>
        <p>I was spending my whole days during two weeks just to look for something that I would love to get paid for. And after many bad ideas, it came to me, the revelation. I just asked myself "What do I really like since I'm young ?". And the answer at this very moment became obvious: Computers, and everything wich is related to this.</p>
        <p>So I started to think about a way to take advantage of my creativity, being working on a computer. And I found two different ideas: Web designer and <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold">Web Developer</span>. But instinctively, I felt way more attracted by the Developer's path. An</p>

        <span id="section2"></span>
        <h2 class="rubrikName">Where to start ?</h2>
        <p>When I found out my way, I immediately started to take a look at how to build a webpage. This is at this moment that I understood that I was about to invest myself in something big.</p>
        <p>All those languages, all those different ways of thinking and findind informations to get trained... But it didn't matter, because when you're convinced that you found a job that you're going to love, and your mind is set on winner's mod, what can stop you ?</p>
        <p>I started my journey by watching many videos on YouTube about how to become web developer. I didn't know if I needed a university degree or if I could learn everything by myself. All the developers on their videos were saying the same thing: If you have a degree it's a plus, but it's not mandatory. The most important things are to get a lot of knowledge about specific languages, being able to solve problems, and develop your own portfolio as much as you can with various projects.</p>
        <p>Companies are hiring a lots of people in accordance with their skills more than their degrees in this field, from what I know.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 3 -->

        <span id="section3"></span>
        <h2 class="rubrikName">Let's get started !</h2>
        <p>So from now I knew that I could learn by myself, and after few researches, I found out that the usual way of starting to learn coding was to start with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The day after I was watching my first video on <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/en/"><span style="color: black; font-weight: bold">OpenClassroom</span></a>. The courses were easy to understand and really clear, but I was watching many videos on my time off, and I felt like I was learning the very basics but not going deep enough.</p>
        <p>>This is at this moment that I started to be interrested with <a href="https://www.udemy.com/?persist_locale=&locale=en_US"><span style="color: black; font-weight: bold">Udemy</span></a> paying courses. Obviously, I tried it, and today I can honestly say that, depending on the courses you're gonna buy, you're gonna learn a lot, and go through many guided interesting projects that you'll be able to add in your Portfolio. Plus, it's cheap for the content. To let you know, I paid around 100£ the courses to learn everything I need to become a real Web Developer. But I'll be patient because I recently decided to enroll myself into a bootcamp.<br>The one I chose is called "Le Wagon" in London. This is one of the most prestigious coding bootcamp in Europe.</p>
        <p>So of course it's going to cost me a nice purse of money (6500£) for 10 weeks of intensive training. But after all the researches I did, I really think that it is going to be worth it. Plus, at the end of this bootcamp, I'll receive a certificate wich is recognised by the government as a bachelor degree in Web Development. In 10 weeks instead of 3 years, yes, it's insane...</p>
        <p>To finish, I'd like to let you know about an application I'm using everytime I'm transiting in the common transports: It's called <a href="https://getmimo.com/"><span style="color: black; font-weight: bold">Mim0</span></a>. That's a free application with wich you can develop all the basics and make sure that you know them through exercices and quizzes about HTML, CSS and JS. There's also a paying version wich offers a better learning experience, version that I subscribed to.</p>
        <p>To sum up, I started with Open classroom (free courses to learn the basics); then Udemy (online paying courses to go deeper); soon I'll enroll myself into a bootcamp when the COVID-19 crisis will be over (in order to get a certificate recognised by the government and develop my skills about JS and Ruby), and when I'm in the common transports for example, or chilling in the living room, I use the application Mim0 (to consolidate my basics and get more knowledge about cyber security, API's, ect. ...).</p>

        <!-- SECTION 4 -->

        <span id="section4"></span>
        <h2 class="rubrikName">Which language and why ?</h2>
        <p>Very simple for this one, I had to go for the classics and then add few other specific ropes to my bow. I didnt talk about this before but now it has its importance. So, there are different types of Web Developper as you might already know it.</p>

        <div id="typeOfDeveloper">
            <img id="imageTypeOfDeveloper" src="IMG/typesOfDeveloper.png">
            <h2>If you want to learn more about it click <a href="https://glints.com/sg/hired/what-kind-of-developer-to-become/" style="text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">here</span></a></h2>
        </div>
        <div id="myPlan">
            <h3>As far as I'm concerned, here's my "learning language" plan:</h3>
            <p>I'm first going to be a more than descent front-end developer in order to me to find a job as a junior web developer, and thus bath in this middle, instead of learning a new food menu every other month and practice a litle bit when being lucky enough to have some spare time...</p>
            <p>But obviously, my goal is to practice while I'll be front end dev, in order to be able to pretend for a full stack position later. But that's a long term endeavour.</p>
            <h4 class="titleLanguagePlan">Basics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="liContent">HTML 5</li>
                <li class="liContent">CSS 3</li>
                <li class="liContent">JS 7</li>
                <li class="liContent">Bootstrap 4</li>
                <li class="liContent">JQuery</li>
                <li class="liContent">Wordpress</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="titleLanguagePlan">Advanced</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="liContent">ReactJS</li>
                <li class="liContent">PHP</li>
                <li class="liContent">SQL</li>
                <li class="liContent">Ruby</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>To let you know why Ruby and React exactly ?<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold">Ruby</span> because the bootcamp I'd like to do are teaching how to use this framework, wich is one of the most used and looked for by the hiring companies nowadays.<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold">React</span> because it seems really simple to learn after Javascript, and once again, the hiring companies are oftenly seeking for this skill. Does the concept of <em>"offer and demand"</em> speaks to you ?
            To conclude this section shortly, I picked the basics that every developer have to know, and then I picked the framworks in accordance with the simplicity to learn, what are the companies seeking in terms of skills, and are those frameworks going to last over the time.</p>
        <p>So now, let's consider that I finished learning all those stuffs. The question is: What for ?</p>

        <!-- SECTION 5 -->

        <span id="section5"></span>
        <h2 class="rubrikName">My purposes about Web Development</h2>
        <p>Once I decided wich tools to use, I started to wonder "what is the best way for me to leave the hospitality industry as fast as possible and get hired by a company to do something that I love ?". Because after fives stimulating years working in hospitality, I feel like it's time to retire. In order to reach this goal rapidly, two important points need to e completed. The first one is that I have to invest my whole free time into coding and learning. Bye bye my social life for a while, but I know already that it's going to be worth it. The second one is that I have to focus on the very basics (HTML / CSS / JS), to be able to apply for a front end developer job as fast as possible. I'll reach the full stack position later. The most important for me is to find a way to bath in a codding environment. Being surounded by other experienced developers would be a great opportunity to learn even more and faster, that's logic. So that's what I'm up to right now.</p>
        <p>Of course I heard that it was even possible to do this activity as a freelancer. But because I know that I still have a lot to learn to become a very qualified developer, I decided to do everything wich is possible to get hired by a company / startup seeking for juniors dev with volunty so I could learn and grow fast. I'm a hard worker so 10-12 hours a day doesn't frighten me. And at the begining I'll be ready to stick to the minimum salary of the job offers to maximize my chances to get hired. That's going to be my strategie in order to get hired without experience or degree. I won't be greedy, my main goal is to be in this field as I already said it.</p>
        <p>But to be honest, of course the idea of being a digital nomad is interesting. And I'll probably think about it in the future, but everything in its time.</p>
        <p>Just before applying, when I'll be very confident with my skills about JS, I'll try to create an account on Fiver, and realise few projects for few bucks. According to how hard it is going to be, I'll decide then to look for the jobs around London or not ! *dreaming*</p>

        <!-- SECTION 6 -->

        <span id="section6"></span>
        <h2 class="rubrikName">Feelings about it</h2>
        <p>I feel really happy, I finally find a real purpose for my life jobwise talking. I feel like I'm clever enough to understand eveyrthing that I read/see, even when it's in english (wich is not my native language, I'm pretty much sure that you noticed that already ! I'm french ! #baguette #fromage #TourEiffel). I'm comfortable with that.</p>
        <p>Plus, I don't get bored by what I'm doing. To give you an exemple, at the moment I'm writting this, it is exactly 3:22PM, and I didn't eat yet. And I went to sleep at 4am earlier today after writting the first lines of the sections above.</p>
        <p>So to make it simple: I feel happy and at ease. Motivation and discipline will be the keys of my success.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 7 -->

        <span id="section7"></span>
        <h2 class="rubrikName">What's happening now / Actuality</h2>
        <p><span style="color: black; font-weight: bold">Thursday 19-11-2020 15:31 </span>Now, I'm actually practicing by accomplishing projects with CSS and HTML. This one will be the last one without JavaScript. Then I'll keep pushing to get an advanced level in JS. I feel like I'm not that far from reaching my first goal: Becoming a front end developer. I'm not going to thank the COVID-19, but because of this 2nd lockdown I have a lot of free time to push my courses. I scheduled to enroll myself for the bootcamp "LeWagon" (I was talking about above), in the begining of this year 2021 comming. I'm now pushing as much as I can to be ready for this. And I'll be.</p>
        <p><span style="color: black; font-weight: bold">Sunday 27-12-2020 16:16 </span>So from now HTML and CSS it's done. And I started to push my knoledge about JS, Jquery and Bootstrap. Actually, I just finished my first paid project using Bootstrap. You can have a look at it in the section "PORTFOLIO" on my CV main page. The one which led you here. It took me around 10 hours but it's because I needed to check every class attribut for Bootstrap 4 since I've been studying with the 3.3.6 version, and pretty much everything changed between those two versions.</p>
        <p>From now, I'm gonna start a new course on Udemy, wich is full of exercices about methods, functions etc. on Javascript.I know JS is my ultimate point to work on in order to get a job as a junior. So I'm gonna push extremly hard from tomorrow. Thank's god I'm in lockdown again (the third one yes...). It might last 1-2 more months, so that gives me enough time to reach a very good level at JS.</p>
        <p>See you soon guys, I'll come back to post whenever I'll feel like I became really good at it.</p>
        <p>PS: I have to update this website with bootstrap to make it responsive. I'll do it after mastering Javascript wich is for me more important at this very moment.</p>
